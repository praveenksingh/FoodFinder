Inspiration<br>
Temptation of food when people see others checkins about eating.

What it does? <br>
It checks all the posts on facebook with tags "eating". Reads the food item mentioned in the post, searches for places around users current location serving that food and embeds the result just below that post. User doesn't need to google it. The results are just there for him.

<br>
A Webservice to get details about the requested food item using google places API and consuming the result by the chrome extension that embeds it on the Facebook page.
